We, the people of South Africa,

Recognise the injustices of our past;

Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land;

Respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and

Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.

We therefore, through our freely elected representatives, adopt this Constitution as the supreme law of the Republic so as to –

*	Heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights;
*	Lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally protected by law;
*	Improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each person; and
*	Build a united and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place as a sovereign state in the family of nations.

May God protect our people.\\
